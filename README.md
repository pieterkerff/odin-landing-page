# odin-landing-page

This is going to be my attempt at the Landing Page project from The Odin Project.
The assignment is to make a landing page from scratch, by following a template provided by them.
The fonts and colors are also provided.

I finished it! this was even more fun than the recipe project!
Really loved to work things with out with flexbox.
